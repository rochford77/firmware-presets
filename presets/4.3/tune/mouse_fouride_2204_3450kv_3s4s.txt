#$ TITLE: 4" 2204 3450kv 3s/4s (Fouride)
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: TUNE
#$ STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL
#$ KEYWORDS: tune, pid
#$ AUTHOR: Ryan Rochford (mouseFPV) (Rochford77)
#$ DESCRIPTION: This is for a 4" 2204 quad
#$ DESCRIPTION: Use with 5" Clean Build RPM Filter
#$ DESCRIPTION: Works best with my Smooth Freestyle RC Smoothing 
#$ DESCRIPTION: Works best with my Rates
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Overwrites all settings mentioned below to defaults.  The User cannot retain their previous values.
#$ DESCRIPTION: DOES NOT reset rates, filters, rc_smoothing, and many other parameters. 
#$ DESCRIPTION: Cell count selections Intended for 3450kv 2203/4 motor
#$ DESCRIPTION: Recommended ESC: 30% Rampup | 23deg Timing | 48k PWM
#$ DESCRIPTION: Choose Option for Dynamic Idle For Best Results
